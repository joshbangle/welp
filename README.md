## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This setup expects [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Ruby v 2.5.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), and [Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/) to be installed. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) is used for the database.

If you prefer not to worry about the Ruby version, you can navigate to spaz/Gemfile and on line 4 comment out `ruby '2.5.3'` to look like `# ruby '2.5.3` once you have cloned the repository.

### Installing the code

To view this code on your local machine, clone the repository, install the included gems, and migrate the database:
```
git clone git@github.com:joshbangle/welp.git
cd grammable
bundle install
rails db:setup
rails db:migrate
```

## Built with

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on the [Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/) framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) css framework for styling
* [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) user authentication
* [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for cloud storage
